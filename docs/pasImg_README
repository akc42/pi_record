This README is instructions on how to take the base image that has been loaded as an operating system
in the PAS server and to ensure we are up to date and running with pas in the shortest possible time.

Hopefully the majority of the system is there - we might be running an out of date version of the system, 
but it should be enough to run for the day, once the instructions below are followed.

-	In order to minimise the size of the image file, we only kept the start of it.
	We need to grow the partition and add a swap file.  So this is the first thing
  	to do.  
  	- 	fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
  		use "bc" (not locally installed) to help with the following calculations
  	
   	-	p to get a partition table  let X = sectors on card - 2097152 (1GB swap in 512 Byte Sectors) 
   		Take X and round down so its exactly divisible by 8192 = call that Y
  
 	-	delete partiton 2 and recreate it starting at same point as before but ending at Y-1 sector
   		DO NOT overwrite filesystem signature
   
	-	create partition 3 starting at Y and going to end of disk  make it type 82 (swap)
   
  	-	write new partition table and exit
  
	-	mkswap -L swap /dev/mmcblk0p3

	-	edit /etc/fstab to uncomment the swap filesystem

	-	swapon
	
	-	btrfs filesystem resize max /mnt/btrfs_pool
	
	
-	load up the latest version of the pas and get it running
	
	- 	mount /mnt/week  to get at backups on main server
	-	tar -xzf /mnt/week/pas.tar.gz -C /mnt/btrfs_pool/_pas
	-	On seperate terminal ssh to pas user and 
		-	cd pasv5 and pm2 start pas.json
		-	cd test	 and pm2 start pas.json
		- 	check logs pm2 logs to see all is running ok
		
At this point we should have a fully running system.  However we also would like to recover a more up to date root filesystem

	-	tar -xzf /mnt/week/rootfs.tar.gz -C /mnt/btrfs_pool/_root
FROM 29th Nov 2021 the following should not be necessary as we did it before creating the tar
	-	clear out the mail find /mnt/btrfs_pool/_root/var/spool/postfix/{defer,bounce,maildrop,incoming,active,deferred,hold,flush} -type f -exec rm {} \;
END OF CHANGE	
	
	-	edit /boot/cmdline.txt to make _root the subvol to boot from	 
	
We should be able to shutdown and reboot

Finally remove _initialroot
-	btrfs subvolume delete -c /mnt/btrfs_pool/_initialroot
