These are the instructions on how to set up a brand new sd card for RECORDER.
It will use the previously prepared btrfs image stored outside of this
directory.

If you are not the author reading this, you can make it to this point using the
BTRFS_README also stored in the director


9) Make a sd card for use in new pi hardware 

dd bs=4M if=rpi-btrfs.img of=/dev/sdX
fdisk /dev/sdX

   p to get a partition table  let X = sectors on card - 2097152 (1GB swap in 512 Byte Sectors) 
   
   Take X and round down so its exactly divisible by 8192 = call that Y
   
   delete partiton 2 and recreate it starting at same point as before but ending at Y-1 sector
   		DO NOT overwrite filesystem signature
   
   create partition 3 starting at Y and going to end of disk  make it type 82 (swap)
   
   write new partition table and exit
   
mkswap -L swap /dev/sdX3
mount -o subvol=/ /dev/sdX2 dst
btrfs filesystem resize max dst
vim dst/_root/etc/hostname and change it to the correct on for your use (recorder)
umount /dev/sdX2

If running on newer hardware and/or want to enable wifi then we need to do the
following 

mount /dev/sdX1 dst vim dst/config.txt change initramfs7.img to
initramfs8.img on the top level add arm_64bit=1

comment out dtoverlay=disable-wifi

umount /dev/sdX1

put it in the new raspberrypi and power on.  You should be able to ssh pi@newhostname to get into it and do things

RECORDER

Currently 128GB SD Card - but doesn't need that much! going to convert to 64GB

BUSTER

Going to upgrade to a 512Gb Card when it arrives,



Before finishing all of this I need to read and experiment with this article (AND THE COMMENTS BELOW)
